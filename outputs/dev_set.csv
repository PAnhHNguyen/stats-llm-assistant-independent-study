"In order to remain competitive in global markets, many corporations have reorganized their operations, often through “downsizing” or “reductions in force” (RIF) in which substantial numbers of employees are laid off. Because federal and state laws require that employees be treated equally regardless of age, claims of discrimination often arise around whether older workers are disproportionately affected. In one recent corporate RIF, data were collected on whether employees remained with the company or were terminated, along with whether they were under 40 or part of the legally protected group of employees aged 40 and older. Researchers wanted to determine if age group was related to the likelihood of being laid off.",logistic regression

Researchers wanted to investigate whether proximity to fast-food outlets was associated with a higher likelihood of students being overweight.",logistic regression
"Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an “isolation” experience.

After the experience, all subjects were given the MMPI test, and their psychopathic deviant T scores were recorded. The researchers then compared the results from the two groups to determine whether the therapeutic tape had an effect.",two-sample t-test
