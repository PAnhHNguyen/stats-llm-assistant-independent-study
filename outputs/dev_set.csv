"In order to remain competitive in global markets, many corporations have reorganized their operations, often through “downsizing” or “reductions in force” (RIF) in which substantial numbers of employees are laid off. Because federal and state laws require that employees be treated equally regardless of age, claims of discrimination often arise around whether older workers are disproportionately affected. In one recent corporate RIF, data were collected on whether employees remained with the company or were terminated, along with whether they were under 40 or part of the legally protected group of employees aged 40 and older. Researchers wanted to determine if age group was related to the likelihood of being laid off.",logistic regression

Overweight status was determined based on student responses to the California Healthy Kids Survey, while geographic data were used to identify whether each school had a fast-food restaurant located within a half-mile radius. Researchers wanted to investigate whether proximity to fast-food outlets was associated with a higher likelihood of students being overweight.",logistic regression
"Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an “isolation” experience. The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects’ psychopathic deviant T scores. This score measures a person’s need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test. The experiment had three treatment groups: (1) Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute “therapeutic” tape advising that professional help is available. (2) Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute “emotionally neutral” tape on training hunting dogs. (3) Four hours of sensory restriction but no taped message. Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups, and an MMPI test was administered before and after the treatment.

What test can be used to independently test the effectiveness of each treatment?",two-sample t-test
