"Exergames are active video games that involve movement, such as dancing, balance board simulators, or virtual sports. A study of 10th- and 11th-grade students in Montreal investigated whether concern about health was associated with participation in exergaming. Among 358 students who reported that they stressed about their health, 29.9% said they were exergamers. Among 851 students who did not report health-related stress, 20.8% said they were exergamers. Researchers wanted to know if students who stressed about their health were more likely to participate in exergaming.",logistic regression

The researchers then examined which factors were associated with unusually low tipping, using a set of stereotype-related variables as possible predictors.",logistic regression

"Timber yield is approximately equal to the volume of a tree, however, this value is difficult to measure without first cutting the tree down. Instead, other variables, such as height and diameter, may be used to predict a tree’s volume and yield.

Height is measured in feet, diameter in inches (at 54 inches above ground), and volume in cubic feet.",multiple linear regression

"Let’s consider a limited set of climate data, examining temperature differences in 1948 vs 2018. We sampled 197 locations from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s (NOAA) historical data, where the data was available for both years of interest. We want to know: were there more days with temperatures exceeding 90°F in 2018 or in 1948?12 The difference in number of days exceeding 90°F (number of days in 2018 - number of days in 1948) was calculated for each of the 197 locations. The average of these differences was 2.9 days with a standard deviation of 17.2 days.

"Subjects from Central Prison in Raleigh, NC, volunteered for an experiment involving an “isolation” experience. The goal of the experiment was to find a treatment that reduces subjects’ psychopathic deviant T scores. This score measures a person’s need for control or their rebellion against control, and it is part of a commonly used mental health test called the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) test. The experiment had three treatment groups: (1) Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute “therapeutic” tape advising that professional help is available. (2) Four hours of sensory restriction plus a 15 minute “emotionally neutral” tape on training hunting dogs. (3) Four hours of sensory restriction but no taped message. Forty-two subjects were randomly assigned to these treatment groups, and an MMPI test was administered before and after the treatment. Distributions of the differences between pre and post treatment scores (pre - post) are given, along with some sample statistics. What test can be used to compare the success of different treatments?",anova

"Prices of diamonds are determined by what is known as the 4 Cs: cut, clarity, color, and carat weight. The prices of diamonds go up as the carat weight increases, but the increase is not smooth. For example, the difference between the size of a 0.99 carat diamond and a 1 carat diamond is undetectable to the naked human eye, but the price of a 1 carat diamond tends to be much higher than the price of a 0.99 diamond. In this question we use two random samples of diamonds, 0.99 carats and 1 carat, each sample of size 23, and compare the average prices of the diamonds. In order to be able to compare equivalent units, we first divide the price for each diamond by 100 times its weight in carats. That is, for a 0.99 carat diamond, we divide the price by 99. For a 1 carat diamond, we divide the price by 100. The distributions and some sample statistics are shown below. What test can be used to evaluate if there is a difference between the average standardized prices of 0.99 and 1 carat diamonds.",two-sample t-test
